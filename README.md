This is a demonstration of the technology behind several projects I've done using shaders with photographs on textures. In it are two examples of how I use the ping pong buffer. The first, titled blue just shows how to take an image to blue, the second, redspread, is a more complicated piece using some basic cellular automata. This work and more can be found on my website, ethanedwards.org. 

This project uses openFramworks 9.8 and ought to be placed within the apps directory of openFrameworks. It was made for OSX but should work for other versions. For a basic introduction to shaders that was used in making this, see the relevant chapter in the OFBook.

To switch between examples, simply uncomment the relevant example and recomment the non-used example.

Please use this code however you would like. Significant credit belongs to the creators of the GaussianBlur standard example in openFrameworks as well as the whole community for creating an excellent learning environment.

Use this code however you would like, but please seek permission before reusing the flower image.
